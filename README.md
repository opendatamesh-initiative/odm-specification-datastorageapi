The **DatastoreAPI Specification (DSAS)** is a community-driven open specification that declaratively defines, using a JSON or YAML descriptor document, the API to establish a connection and query a database service managing tabular data.  It is released under [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE). Contributions from the data community are welcomed!
